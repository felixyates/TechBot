# TechBot

Just a simple Discord bot that I'm trying to build :)
I only intend for it to be used for 2 servers - one is mine and one is my friend's and we only use them  to play games, etc.

## Features so far
* Text responder. The bot responds to certain messages with an image.
* Audio player. So far, we've had the FNAF phone call and cats mating. Not a great start.

## Available commands *(prefix: >)*
*Note, you can view these at any time with the command >help*

### Random
* add - Adds two numbers together
* ping - Returns 'pong' if the bot is active
* servers - Lists some cool beans servers you should join
* hello - Says 'world'

### Moderation
* kick {mention-user} - Simple kick command
* ban {mention-user} - Simple ban command

### Voice
* cats - Don't even ask. Harry's idea.
* fnaf - Plays the FNAF phone call in the voice channel
* leave - Makes the bot leave the voice channel
* stop - Stops the currently playing audio in the voice channel

### In development
* pause - Pauses the currently playing audio in the voice channel
* resume - Resumes the currently playing audio in the voice channel
