# TechBot

Just a simple Discord bot that I'm trying to build :) I only intend for it to be used for 3 servers - two are mine (the first for solo testing, the second for chilling) and the third is my friend's (also for chilling).

## Features
- [x] Text responder. The bot responds to certain messages with an image.
- [x] Slur detector. Block out the -ists and -phobes.
- [x] Custom welcome messages.
- [x] Music recommendations (using Spotify API, YouTube is WIP!)
- [ ] More on the way :)
