# TechBot

Just a simple Discord bot that I'm trying to build :) I only intend for it to be used for a few servers of mine and my friends, but maybe some people will find it helpful.

## Features
- [x] Text responder. The bot responds to certain messages with an image.
- [x] Slur detector. Block out the -ists and -phobes.
- [x] Custom welcome messages.
- [x] Music recommendations (using the Spotify and YouTube APIs)
- [ ] More on the way :)

## Available commands *(default prefix: >)*
*Note, you can view these at any time with the command `help` or by pinging the bot.*
